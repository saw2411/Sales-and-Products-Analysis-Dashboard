## üìù Introduction

This project presents a comprehensive **Sales Data Analysis** dashboard built using **Power BI**. The dashboard enables users to interactively explore and visualize key sales metrics, trends, and performance indicators across multiple regions, products, and time periods. It was developed as part of a personal portfolio to demonstrate skills in data modeling, DAX calculations, and business intelligence storytelling.
